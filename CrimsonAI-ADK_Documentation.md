## Multi-Agent System

### Agent Implementation

The system implements four specialized agents using Google ADK:

#### 1. DecisionAgent
```python
decision_agent = LlmAgent(
    name="DecisionAgent",
    model=LLM_MODEL,
    instruction=DECISION_PROMPT,
    description="Analyzes user queries and classifies them into recommendation, inquiry, or clarification actions",
    output_key="decision_result",
)
```

**Purpose**: Classifies user queries into three categories:
- **recommendation**: User mentions career goals
- **inquiry**: User asks about specific courses
- **clarification_needed**: Vague or unclear queries

#### 2. RecommendationAgent
```python
recommendation_agent = LlmAgent(
    name="RecommendationAgent",
    model=LLM_MODEL,
    instruction=f"{user_context}\n\n{RECOMMENDATION_PROMPT}",
    description="Provides personalized course recommendations based on career goals and available courses",
    output_key="recommendation_result",
    tools=[get_course_recommendations]
)
```

**Purpose**: Provides personalized course recommendations based on:
- Career aspirations
- Academic interests
- Skill development needs
- Available courses in database

#### 3. InquiryAgent
```python
inquiry_agent = LlmAgent(
    name="InquiryAgent",
    model=LLM_MODEL,
    instruction=INQUIRY_PROMPT,
    description="Handles specific course information requests and provides detailed course details",
    output_key="inquiry_result",
    tools=[get_course_details]
)
```

**Purpose**: Provides detailed information about specific courses including:
- Course descriptions
- Prerequisites
- Credit hours
- Typical semester offerings

#### 4. ClarificationAgent
```python
clarification_agent = LlmAgent(
    name="ClarificationAgent",
    model=LLM_MODEL,
    instruction=CLARIFICATION_PROMPT,
    description="Generates clarifying questions for vague or unclear user queries",
    output_key="clarification_result",
)
```

**Purpose**: Generates clarifying questions for vague queries to better understand user intent.

## Implementation Details

### Core Components Explained

#### 1. Agent Orchestration (`agent.py`)

**Purpose**: This is the central nervous system of the application that defines how all agents interact and coordinate.

**Key Implementation Details**:

```python
# Root Agent - The Main Orchestrator
course_recommendation_workflow = LlmAgent(
    name="CourseRecommendationWorkflow",
    model=LLM_MODEL,
    instruction="""
    You are the Course Recommendation Workflow.

    **Important: Never return the classification result from DecisionAgent to the user.**

    Steps:
    1. Always call DecisionAgent to classify.
    2. Based on the classification, call exactly one of: RecommendationAgent, InquiryAgent, or ClarificationAgent.
    3. Only return the output from the second agent to the user. The intermediate JSON from DecisionAgent must be ignored.
        
        Always maintain conversation context and ensure smooth transitions between agents.
    """,
    description="Coordinates the course recommendation workflow between specialized agents",
    sub_agents=[
        decision_agent,
        recommendation_agent,
        inquiry_agent,
        clarification_agent,
    ],
)
```

**How It Works**:
- **Root Agent**: `CourseRecommendationWorkflow` acts as the main entry point
- **Sub-Agent Management**: Contains all specialized agents as sub-agents
- **Flow Control**: Manages the conversation flow and ensures only appropriate responses reach the user
- **Context Preservation**: Maintains conversation context across agent transitions

**Decision Agent Implementation**:
```python
decision_agent = LlmAgent(
    name="DecisionAgent",
    model=LLM_MODEL,
    instruction=DECISION_PROMPT,
    description="Analyzes user queries and classifies them into recommendation, inquiry, or clarification_needed actions",
    output_key="decision_result",
)
```

**Purpose**: Acts as the intelligent router that determines which specialized agent should handle the user's query.

**Classification Logic**:
- **"recommendation"**: When user mentions career goals (e.g., "I want to become a data scientist")
- **"inquiry"**: When user asks about specific courses (e.g., "Tell me about CS 101")
- **"clarification_needed"**: When query is vague or unclear

#### 2. Prompt Engineering (`prompts.py`)

**Purpose**: Contains all the carefully crafted prompts that guide each agent's behavior and responses.

**DECISION_PROMPT Explanation**:
```python
DECISION_PROMPT = """
You are a highly intelligent Course Recommendation Assistant.

Your primary task is to analyze user queries and classify them into a structured JSON format with one of the following actions:

1. "recommendation" — If the user mentions a **career goal** (e.g., "I want to become a data scientist"), extract the goal and set the action to "recommendation". The query should then be handled by the **recommendation_agent**.

2. "inquiry" — If the user is asking about a **specific course** (e.g., course description, timing, instructor), extract the course name and set the action to "inquiry". The query should then be handled by the **inquiry_agent**.

3. "clarification_needed" — If the user's message is vague, lacks a clear goal or course, or is playful/unserious, set the action to "clarification_needed". The query should then be handled by the **clarification_agent**.
"""
```

**Key Features**:
- **Structured Classification**: Forces agents to return consistent JSON format
- **Clear Decision Rules**: Explicit criteria for each classification type
- **Context Awareness**: Considers conversation history and user intent
- **Error Prevention**: Handles edge cases and ambiguous queries

        try:
            # Create cache directory if it doesn't exist
            os.makedirs(CACHE_DIR, exist_ok=True)
            
            # Check if model is already cached
            model_cache_path = os.path.join(CACHE_DIR, MODEL_NAME.replace("/", "_"))
            
            if os.path.exists(model_cache_path):
                logger.info(f"Loading cached model from: {model_cache_path}")
                _model_cache = SentenceTransformer(model_cache_path)
            else:
                logger.info(f"Downloading and caching model: {MODEL_NAME}")
                _model_cache = SentenceTransformer(MODEL_NAME)
                
                # Cache the model for future use
                _model_cache.save(model_cache_path)
                logger.info(f"Model cached to: {model_cache_path}")
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Error loading sentence transformer model: {e}")
            return None
    return _model_cache
```

**Key Features**:

def get_course_recommendations(query: str, user_id: Optional[str] = None, top_n: int = 10) -> str:
    """
    Get course recommendations based on the user's query.
    
    Args:
        query (str): User's query about courses or career goals
        user_id (str): Optional user ID for personalized recommendations
        top_n (int): Number of recommendations to return
    
    Returns:
        str: JSON string containing course recommendations
    """
```

    """Generate embedding for text using cached sentence transformer"""
    try:
        model = get_sentence_transformer()
        if model is None:
            logger.error("Sentence transformer model not available")
            return None
        
        # Generate embedding
        embedding = model.encode(text, convert_to_numpy=True)
        return embedding.tolist()
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error generating embedding: {e}")
        return None
```

**How Semantic Search Works**:
1. **Text Processing**: Converts user queries and course descriptions to numerical vectors
2. **Similarity Calculation**: Uses cosine similarity to find matching courses
3. **Context Understanding**: Considers semantic meaning, not just keywords
4. **Ranking**: Orders results by relevance score

**Model Configuration**:

### How CourseRecommendationWorkflow Works Automatically

The `CourseRecommendationWorkflow` operates seamlessly in the background through Google ADK's intelligent agent orchestration system without requiring any manual intervention. When a user sends a message, the workflow automatically routes it through a sophisticated decision-making process: first, the DecisionAgent classifies the user's intent (recommendation, inquiry, or clarification needed), then the system automatically calls the appropriate specialized agent (RecommendationAgent, InquiryAgent, or ClarificationAgent) based on this classification.

The workflow maintains conversation context across all agent transitions, automatically manages tool integrations for database queries, and ensures only the final, relevant response reaches the user. This entire process happens behind the scenes through Google ADK's declarative programming model, where you simply define the agents and their relationships, and the framework handles all complex coordination, error handling, performance optimization, and state management automatically.

**Key Points:**

• **Zero Manual Orchestration**: No if/else statements or routing logic needed - the instruction text IS the orchestration logic

• **Automatic Agent Selection**: System intelligently chooses the right agent based on user intent classification

• **Seamless Context Management**: Conversation history and user context automatically preserved across all agent interactions

• **Intelligent Tool Integration**: Database queries and tool executions happen automatically when needed by specialized agents

• **Error Resilience**: Failed agent calls, tool executions, and other errors are automatically handled and retried

• **Performance Optimization**: Load balancing, memory management, and resource optimization handled automatically

• **Scalable Architecture**: Can handle multiple concurrent users without manual coordination or state management

• **Declarative Programming**: Focus on defining what agents should do, not how they should coordinate
